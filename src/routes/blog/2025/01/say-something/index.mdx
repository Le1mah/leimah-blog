# Say Something

## Translation version

While watching Falcons vs. Tundra, I’m thinking about writing something.

The first quarter of this year feels like it’s been packed with events:
- Traveled abroad with Carl to Japan—ran into a bizarre shopkeeper in Osaka on the first day. Thankfully, the people we met afterward were great, which redeemed the experience.
- Just after returning, I went on a business trip, meeting a lot of new faces. I learned the importance of speaking up more. Naturally, it’s this mood that’s driven me to write this diary entry.
- Then there was the Hackathon. I picked up some problem-solving insights from the team leader. Defining a clear scope is something I’ve always lacked, so I’ll make a serious effort to improve on that.

In between, there were subtle experiences bouncing between different groups; the uneven dynamics of interacting with peers or even younger people, and the creeping sense of inferiority that followed; plus helping Carl look for a new job, among other things.

It’s already 1:51 AM now. Though writing has eased some of my earlier unease, I should save some energy for tomorrow.

So, sweet dreams, and until we meet again o(\*￣▽￣\*)o

## Original text

一边看 Falcons 打 Tundra，一边想着写点什么。

今年的第一季度似乎发生了很多事情：
- 和卡尔一起出国旅行，去了日本——第一天在大阪就偶遇奇葩店家。好在之后遇到的人都很好，成功挽回了体验。
- 方才回国又赶去出差，这次和很多人打了照面。懂得了要多发出一些自己的声音。自然，就是这样的心情促使我写下的这篇日记。
- 之后又是 Hackathon。从队长那里学到了不少分析问题的思路。建立一个明确的 Scope 是我一直缺少的素质之一，今后认真补上吧。

中间还有在各个组之间辗转的微妙经历；处同龄人、甚至低龄人感受到的参差，以及进一步感到的自卑感；以及和卡尔一起帮他找一个新工作的经历等等等等。

只是现在已经 1:51。虽然动笔后，先前的不安便有所改善，但总归要保存一些精力到明天。

所以，祝君好梦，改日我们再见 o(\*￣▽￣\*)o
